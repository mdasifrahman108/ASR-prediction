# ASR-prediction
lkaliâ€“silica reaction (ASR) is a material degradation mechanism that occurs in concrete structures. ASR is the most common source of concrete deterioration worldwide and is of more significance in the United States. It is a chemical reaction occurring between the reactive siliceous aggregate particles and hydroxyl ions of the pore solution in hardened concrete. It's a long-time degradation process, and the lab tests within this time frame might not be feasible in terms of the inherent chemical reaction. Therefore, a rigorous observation and prediction of ASR can provide useful information regarding the potential ASR expansion or the degree (extent) of ASR over time. However, a very small ASR data are available from the existing lab tests.  Within this context, I will utilize GAN for the sample data generation of ASR expansion based on my simulated data under the stochastic weather conditions. I will also work through LSTM approach for the ASR expansion prediction.
